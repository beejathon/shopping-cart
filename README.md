## Reflection

The intention for this project was to focus on practicing using react-router-dom to create a single-page-application as well as testing via the React testing library. I intended to write unit tests as I went along but got swept up in building the each component since it all came together quicker than expected and worked without much fiddling around. As it stands, I consider this project unfinished as I did not follow through with the essential task of writing tests. The lesson to be learned here? Write the tests first! There are also several features I wish to add such as a modal for the item detail in the shop as well as a more extensive product catalog that can be filtered and searched.
